I am a second-year CS + Math undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.
Most of my work consists of open-source contributions to libraries such as [MathJS](https://mathjs.org) and
personal projects that I find useful and/or fun.

See my [website](https://davidtranhq.github.io) for more.

Currently seeking Summer 2022 SWE internships.
